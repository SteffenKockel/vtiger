vTiger CRM
======

Yet another unofficial repo for the vTiger CRM

## Why?

I struggled a lot with vTiger upgrades and ended up trying vTigers SVN, which was a bad idea, because it is outdated! So checking out the 6.0.0 branch from there still left me with a 5.4.0 version.  

I have no intention to maintain something here, but I needed a possibility to rollback in my upgrade process. Since I spent a few hours figuring out this process, I thought someone might save some time upgrading a vTiger installation or creating a new one.

I have created a few scripts to make life easier. You can find them in the `tools` folder, that exists in the master branch. It's meant to get checked out in your local branch to customize the toolset for your needs.

This documet covers the following topics

* [Fresh Install](FRESHINSTALL.md)
* [Migrations](MIGRATIONS.md)
* [Development environment](DEVEL.md)
* [Multi-Origin setup](MODEVELSETUP.md)
